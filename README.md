# A template for Node.js + React projects

The files in the *frontend* directory were created with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

The template application *server.js*:
1. serves files from the React app
2. can be extended to provide an API to the React app
3. handles graceful shutdowns when run as a Docker Container
